## Intro
A simple *Wellness* app 
The app has two main functionalities:  
 * A water counter to track your water intake.    
 * A list of wellness tasks to do throughout the day.

## What I learnt 

  -  How to think about ``state and events`` in a Jetpack Compose UI.
  -  How Compose uses ``state to determine`` which ``elements to display on the screen``.
  -  What ``state hoisting`` is.
  -  How ``stateful and stateless composable`` functions work.
  -  How Compose ``automatically tracks state`` with the State<T> API.
  -  How ``memory`` and ``internal state work`` in a composable function: using the ``remember`` and ``rememberSaveable APIs``.
  -  How to ``work with lists and state``: using the ``mutableStateListOf`` and ``toMutableStateList`` APIs.
  -  How to use ``ViewModel with Compose``.
